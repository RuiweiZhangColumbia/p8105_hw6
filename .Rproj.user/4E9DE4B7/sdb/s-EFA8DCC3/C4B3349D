Regulation violations are each worth a pre-specified number of points, which are totaled at the end of the inspection. Scores are converted into grades, where a lower score earns a higher grade.\n\nEach violation falls into one of three categories:\n\nA public health hazard, such as failing to store food at an appropriate temperature, results in a minimum score of 7\n\nA critical violation, such as improperly washing raw vegetables prior to serving, results in a minimum score of 5\n\nA general violation, such as improperly sanitizing cookware, results in a minimum score of 2\n\nAdditional points can then be assigned based on the severity of the violation, ranging from 1-5, at the discretion of the inspector.\n\nMore details about the scoring and grading process can be found here.\n\n",
